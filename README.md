# Laravel Deployment

This is a shell based installation and update tool for Laravel applications.

In principle it creates a randomly named folder, clones the project with a given branch, handles all relevant install-commands and creates a symlink with a given name.

The update script works similarly: It copies the current install into a new folder, pulls from git, handles all relevant update-commands, updates the symlink and creates a "backup" of the last working install.

## Basic usage

Clone this repo and run

```bash
./install.sh -b develop -n prod
```

to install the `develop` branch of [Tr√§welling](https://github.com/Traewelling/traewelling) inside of a folder named `prod`.

To update it, simply run

```bash
./update.sh -b develop -p prod
```
